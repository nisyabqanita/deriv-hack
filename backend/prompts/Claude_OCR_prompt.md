**Task:**  
You are an AI assistant tasked with extracting transaction details from an OCR-processed bank transaction statement. The extracted details should be **structured and formatted in a machine-readable format (JSON or CSV)** for easy comparison with reference transaction records.  

#### **Extraction Details:**  
For each transaction entry, extract the following key details:  

1. **Transaction ID** – The unique identifier for the transaction.  
2. **Transaction Amount** – The sum of the transaction, including currency.  
3. **Transaction Date & Time** – The timestamp of the transaction in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). If time is missing, provide only the date.  
4. **Country** – The country associated with the transaction (if available).  
5. **Merchant or Payee Name** – The recipient or sender of the transaction.  
6. **Payment Method** – (e.g., credit card, PayPal, wire transfer, etc., if available).  
7. **Transaction Type** – (e.g., purchase, withdrawal, refund, transfer).  
8. **Reference or Memo** – Any additional description related to the transaction.  
9. **Balance After Transaction** – If the statement includes balance tracking, extract the balance immediately after the transaction.  

#### **Format:**  
Return the extracted transactions in **JSON format**, structured like this:  

```json
[
  {
    "transaction_id": "ABC123456",
    "transaction_amount": "120.50 USD",
    "transaction_date_time": "2024-06-15 14:23:45",
    "country": "United States",
    "merchant_name": "Amazon",
    "payment_method": "Credit Card",
    "transaction_type": "Purchase",
    "reference_memo": "Online Order #56789",
    "balance_after_transaction": "4820.75 USD"
  },
  {
    "transaction_id": "XYZ789012",
    "transaction_amount": "50.00 MYR",
    "transaction_date_time": "2024-06-16",
    "country": "Malaysia",
    "merchant_name": "GrabPay",
    "payment_method": "E-Wallet",
    "transaction_type": "Top-up",
    "reference_memo": "GrabPay Reload",
    "balance_after_transaction": "4770.75 MYR"
  }
]
```

#### **Guidelines:**  
- Ensure all **transaction amounts retain their original currency format** (e.g., USD, EUR, MYR).  
- If **any field is missing in the statement**, leave it as `null` instead of making assumptions.  
- Ensure that the **date and time formats are standardized** and avoid ambiguous formats like MM/DD/YYYY.  
- If multiple transactions exist in the statement, return **all transactions as an array**.  
- Preserve text as it appears in the statement without modifying or normalizing values (except for structuring purposes).  
- If OCR has errors (e.g., missing or distorted text), mark the uncertain values as `"uncertain": true` in the JSON output.

### **Usage in Workflow**  
1. **Run OCR on the transaction statement.**  
   - Convert scanned or image-based transaction statements into text.  
2. **Pass the extracted raw text to Claude 3.5 Sonnet using the prompt above.**  
3. **Store the extracted data in JSON or CSV format.**  
4. **Compare the extracted data against reference figures to detect inconsistencies or fraudulent transactions.**  
5. **Return the JSON Value only**
